# opsrdev
[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/poldham/opsrdev.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/poldham/opsrdev)

This is the early development version of the opsr R package to access [EPO Open Patent Services API](http://www.epo.org/searching-for-patents/technical/espacenet/ops.html#tab1)

The main aim of the package is to provide access to the OPS service and, more importantly, to transform the data into data frames that we can perform useful patent analysis with.

opsrdev is not on CRAN. To install it use: 

devtools::install_github("poldham/opsrdev")
