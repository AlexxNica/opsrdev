## Extracting country names from number strings using stringr::str_sub




From R4DS

You can extract parts of a string using `str_sub()`. As well as the string, `str_sub()` takes `start` and `end` arguments which give the (inclusive) position of the substring:

```{r}
x <- c("Apple", "Banana", "Pear")
str_sub(x, 1, 3)
# negative numbers count backwards from end
str_sub(x, -3, -1)
