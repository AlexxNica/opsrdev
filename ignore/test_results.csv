The method of the invention includes the steps of mixing ingredients comprising flour, water and a leavening agent to form a dough. The dough contains less than 2% fat. After fully proofing the dough, the dough is contacted with steam as the sole source of heat used to cook the dough. Thereafter, the cooked dough is frozen. The frozen cooked dough may then be subjected to microwave heating by the end user to provide a palatable warmed, cooked dough product which has retained its palatability, is not tough, and is substantially similar in taste and appearance to counterpart dough product which has been cooked by conventional convection baking.; The cooked dough product is preferably a bagel type dough product, but may be any low-fat dough, such as pizza crust.",en,GEN FOODS INC [US],epodoc,1,EP,19940414,17055201,A,94302663,docdb,examiner,A,1,"DATABASE WPI Section Ch, Week 8639 Derwent Publications

The system expanding the pizza dough under the influence of the centrifugal force is known for a long time. The pizzaiolo (pizza baker) apply it twirling the disk of dough (overhead) in the room for expanding its diameter. Other known mechanical systems for this purpose provide very complicated devices equipped with radially oscillating levers which should guide the dough in its radial expansion. The present invention on the other hand is characterized in that the expansion of the diameter of the disk of dough under the influence of the centrifugal force is effected using an apparatus of very simple design consisting essentially of two plates (2, 3) arranged coaxial one supported by the other.; The method proposed presupposes that the dough be prepared first as a preliminary disk (1) of dough the diameter of which ranges between a third to one half of the desired final diameter of the dough disk, and that this preliminary disk (1) be subject to the influence of the centrifugal force in a room determined on both sides by two rotating plane surfaces. The great simplicity of the apparatus realising the present invention permits its large scale application in every small pizzeria. <IMAGE>",en,GRIECO LEONARDO [IT],epodoc,1,EP,19980818,17330355,A,98810792,docdb,applicant,A,NA,NA,NA,1,DE,NA,docdb,A,0069078,publication number,national-search-report,1,,CPC,NA,I,21,11,A,1,C,004,GRIECO LEONARDO [IT],epodoc,1,1,A21C   3/    02            A I,EP,0904696,22149916,A2,ops.epo.org,NA,NA,19970929,national,228097,1,epodoc,EP,19990331,A2,0904696,docdb,NA,NA,NA,NA,Method and apparatus for producing a dough disk,de,NA,NA,NA,NA

A plenum structure converts some of the continuously recirculated air into a spaced series of laterally diffused, relatively high velocity heated air impingement jets that slightly overlap prior to striking the food support. In this manner, each food support surface subjected to jet impingement is evenly blanketed with heating air to uniformly transfer heat to the food support, and thus to the food supported thereby, at an accelerated rate. In a further embodiment, a dual tier pizza cooking oven is formed from similar, but inverted lower and upper modules. The lower module has a housing with a cooking chamber therein that is floor supported in an elevated position by supports, andincludes a downwardly projecting fan and heating section to recirculate heated air through the housing. The upper module is stacked on top of the lower housing, and includes a fan and heating section that projects upwardly therefrom that recirculates a flow of heated air through its cooking chamber. Perforated metal food support plates are horzontally disposed in each of the two cooking chambers.

This discovery saves at least seven days of aging and permits the use of a continuous process of making mozzarella, which, from pasteurization to loading of the frozen product on the truck, can be performed in as little time as eight hours. In the continuous process, the hot stretched cheese from the kneading machine is extruded directly into cold brine.

The dough is positioned on corrugated paperboard preforms within a tray having multiple circular openings. The preforms have sidewardly opening corrugations.

The preforms are positioned in a rectangular array within the openings in the conveyed tray. A quantity of raw dough is positioned on each preform within the tray. The dough is conveyed on the preforms beneath a bank of high pressure forming dies. The dies are pressed into the openings within the tray and over the dough to form the dough into the desired pizza crust shape. Each die extends between the preform and the tray within the opening to force portions of the dough into the preform corrugations to thereby secure the formed dough to the preform. The dough which extends into the corrugations locks the crust in place, retaining the desired shape until the dough is processed on the preform through a freezer. The crust is never subjected to baking, and thus the yeast within the dough is not killed prior to being supplied to the baker, resulting in a frozen pizza or pizza crust which has substantial attributes of a fresh pizza.

5716658,"To facilitate baking a frozen dough product in an oven having a rack formed of aligned bars, the dough product is formed over an oven-safe paper sheet which has a plurality of die-cut holes. This sheet serves as a baking substrate and obviates the need for a baking pan. The paper sheet is formed with the dough product, and the dough extends through the holes and locks the sheet to the dough. The end user may thus remove the frozen dough product together with the sheet from a backing preform and place the assembly on an oven rack for baking. As the dough thaws the crust will loose its stiffness. The sheet however, will prevent the more pliable crust from distending through the oven rack before the dough has become baked and rigid. The sheet forms a backing which restrains flow of the dough, while at the same time the holes permit the escape of gases from the bottom of the crust and ensure uniform baking. Furthermore, the holes allow direct radiant heating of the dough product through the paper sheet. The position and size of the holes may be adjusted to achieve desired uniformity of baking of the dough product.

The sheet forms a backing which restrains flow of the dough, while at the same time the holes permit the escape of gases from the bottom of the crust and ensure uniform baking. Furthermore, the holes allow direct radiant heating of the dough product through the paper sheet. The position and size of the holes may be adjusted to achieve desired uniformity of baking of the dough product. The finished baked dough product, such as dinner rolls or a pizza crust, may be removed from the oven with the sheet attached thereto, and the baked dough product may be served directly from the sheet.",en,DADCO DIVERSIFIED INC [US],epodoc,1,US,19980209,45917198,A,021056,docdb,examiner,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,EP,NA,docdb,A,0471095,publication number,national-search-report,1,,CPC,425/127,I,21,11,A,1,B,006,DONNELLY DAVIS A [US],epodoc,1,1,A21B   3/    13            A I,US,5919508,26692721,A,ops.epo.org,NA,NA,19940630,national,"268,998",1,epodoc,US,19990706,A,5919508,docdb,NA,NA,NA,NA,Assembly and process for forming dough foodstuffs,en,NA,NA,NA,NA

The process of manufacturing such fat-free or low-fat mozzarella cheese comprises mixing a food grade acid with liquid milk having a fat content less than 1.5% or a casein to fat weight ratio of greater than 1.5. The acidified milk is then coagulated and processed into pizza cheese. No aging is necessary to obtain excellent melting properties. In a preferred embodiment, after coagulation of the milk and cutting of the curd, a portion of the whey is drained and glucono- delta -lactone is added to gradually further decrease the pH.
